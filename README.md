## Overview

Resource Toggle is a lightweight, client-side mod that lets you instantly switch resource packs with a simple keypress - no more digging through Minecraft's settings menu!

## Features

- **Universal Compatibility** - Works with all valid resource packs in your config folder

## How to Use

1. Place your resource packs in the `.minecraft\resourcepacks` directory
2. Open the in-game "mods" menu and go to the resource toggle config menu to select which packs to enable for toggling
3. Use the default **R** key or set your preferred keybind in the Minecraft controls menu
4. Press your assigned key anytime to toggle packs on/off
